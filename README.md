# Regressify-Exploring-the-Art-of-Regression
Welcome to Regressify. This repository is dedicated to exploring the intricacies of multiple linear regression and logistic regression â€“ two fundamental techniques in predictive modeling. 

In this repository, I've meticulously curated a collection of my regression practice projects, focusing primarily on multiple linear regression and logistic regression techniques. 

Here, I've documented my exploration of multiple linear regression and logistic regression techniques as part of my ongoing learning process. Each project reflects my dedication to understanding data patterns, building predictive models, and extracting valuable insights. 

Join me in this learning adventure as I navigate through the fundamentals of regression analysis, honing my skills one project at a time."
